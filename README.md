# Project 03: Scraping from ebay

This repo holds my Project 03, the requirements of which are described [here](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2025spring/project_03_webscraping).
The ebay-dl.py file in this repo collects information on all the listed items in the first 10 pages of search results on ebay for a given search keyword.
The collected information includes each item's listed name, price, status of use, shipping costs, return policy, and how many of the item have sold before.
