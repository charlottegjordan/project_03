# Project 03: Scraping from ebay

This repo holds my Project 03, the requirements of which are described [here](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2025spring/project_03_webscraping).
The ebay-dl.py file in this repo collects information on all the listed items in the first 10 pages of search results on ebay for a given search keyword, then creates a json file compiling all of that information.
The collected information includes each item's listed name, price, status of use, shipping costs, return policy, and how many of the item have sold before.
The repo holds three files, each of which contain the specified information of the items that came up in the first 10 pages of their respecitive keywords, which were "smiski," "jellycat," and "sonny angel."

## How I created those files
